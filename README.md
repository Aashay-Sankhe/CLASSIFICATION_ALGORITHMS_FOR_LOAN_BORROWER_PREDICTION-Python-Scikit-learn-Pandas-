# classification-algorithms-for-banking-transformation
Jupyter notebook containing various classification methods for predicting whether a future customer of a bank is likely to be a borrower.

**About this code**
The data for this file is separated into two separate datasets, which are consolidated into one. EDA is performed on this data to remove null data points and using heatmaps with seaborn to decide which correlations in features result in linear dependencies that are not needed to train the model.
Data1 and Data2 are the two files containing banking information of customers

**Classification methods**
- Standard logistic regression
- Weighted logistic regression
- Regression implemented with Naive Bayes
- SVM implementation
